Trying to summarize your life story is difficult. Here's an attempt through the lens of [an Easter Challenge](https://www.thegospelcoalition.org/article/share-your-jesuschangedmylife-story/).

I think I was born a happy, easy going guy. My mantra was to enjoy life and to help others. However it was only a matter of time until that well-intentioned philosophy became inadequate to address life's complexities. I wanted to help others relationally, but I found myself incapable to do so intellectually, experientially, or existentially. Worse yet I found myself to be so deeply flawed. The severity of my hypocrisy and escapism proved to be too large of a cognitive dissonance from the great guy persona that myself and others believe I was. Too much to just gloss over and say "don't worry about that, we're all struggling to progress on our own journeys of life". Seeking clarity, I began questioning myself and what I believed in. I was raised in the Christian tradition, but never closely examined it. I began having a lot of honest conversations with a number of authentic, humble, and confident people. I admired their lives and how they spoke of an intimate relationship with the god of the Bible. In the Bible, I saw an enormous coherent narrative of restoration and how God didn't need me, but wanted me to participate in it. The beauty and presence of his paradoxical character captivated and healed me. The help to combat my self-righteousness and pride became near. And I really am just stumbling in the general direction of the person he made me to be, away from the darkness inside of me, but I stumble with greater confidence than ever before because he promises to walk with me. My reality is changed because he chose to dwell with me. #JesusChangedMyLife
