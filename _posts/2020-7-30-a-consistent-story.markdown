Is the God portrayed in the New Testament the same God portrayed in the Old Testament? The stereotypes of a "fire and brimestone, wrathful" old testament god and a "love conquers all" new testament god are prolific in our culture. Consequently, it's very hard to believe they are the same, and we are left believing the biblical story is inconsistent. All stereotypes are based in some truth, but also like all stereotypes we should investigate for ourselves with an open mind. Nothing will replace reading chunks or all of the bible for yourself, but another tool to evaluate these stereotypes with more of a clean slate is by reading quotations without knowing if they come from the old or new testament and trying to guess where they come from.

This is exactly what I created.

I created a [10 quotation version](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeglRh3QNYa2STYV0mfCoZkA692hwvBWWYZo-EfTxASiJK1Hg/viewform?usp=sf_link) (also embedded below) and a [59 quotations version](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScJoPkOuU-KkI4r2kc53D-H6vj35oMb2boj0idVxadbcEQF7g/viewform?usp=sf_link). I'd recommend starting with the 10 quotation version before starting with the 59 quotation version.

I truly hope these "quizzes" are helpful for your biblical understanding - that they would be more medidative than entertaining. These quotations were all picked by me as noteworthy passages when I read through the entire bible. If you'd like to see more of the verses I "bookmarked" along my reading journey, you can check out [The Notes Project](http://thenotesproject.surge.sh).

Looking for larger chunks of scripture to evaluate those stereotypes? I'd recommend reading Psalm 103 and Luke 13.
