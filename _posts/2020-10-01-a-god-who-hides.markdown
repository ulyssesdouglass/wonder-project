I heard years ago that God's "Plan A" for salvation of people after the days of Jesus was his followers -- his messy, immature, scattered, inconsistent, infiltrated Church. If this message of salvation was so important, why would God choose a method of communication so unreliable and easily overlooked?

This did not sit well with me; something seemed a little bit off. I felt like the preachers were covering up for a God who spoke mightily before but no longer did. Or perhaps that God never existed and that this was just a convenient way to explain why the early church depicted in the Bible experienced big miracles but we don't.

Then there was the aspect of God's character. The intuitive objection which I've heard over the years is that if God wanted me to believe in him, why doesn't he show up mightily? With writing in the sky? If something was so important to know, why would he hide it?  Why should I believe in a god that says he's compassionate, but seems so distant and hidden?

There is much to be said about this, but consider the following few thoughts that have shaped my perspective in the direction of refuting the hesitations I have just mentioned.

Deeper survey of the Bible has revealed to me that God's message and how he relates to people has been, is, and will continue to be through a subversive means. Take the following three passages for example.

---
- It is the glory of God to **conceal things**, but the glory of kings is to search things out. ~ Proverbs 25:2
- At that time Jesus declared, “I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have **hidden these things** from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children; yes, Father, for such was your gracious will. ~ Matthew 11:25–26
- **This is why I speak to them in parables**, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand. Indeed, in their case the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says: “‘“**You will indeed hear but never understand**,
    and you will indeed see but never perceive.”
For this people's heart has grown dull,
    and with their ears they can barely hear,
    and their eyes they have closed,
lest they should see with their eyes
    and hear with their ears
and understand with their heart
    and turn, and I would heal them.’ ~ Matthew 13:13-15

Further, there are countless stories highlighting God throughout the ages often choosing the non-dominant, near quiet path to accomplish what he wants to. Consider further the literary climax of the bible -- the life of Jesus. The idea of a King of the world entering in a remote, dirty barn, who later had his processional entering on a donkey, and ultimately died alone on a tree.

Over the years of thinking on these things, it has made me realize that this "Plan A", concealed approach to God's character is a Bible thing, not something invented by preachers. We must deal with this character of God as something consistently presented in scripture. Could there be some ancient wisdom at play to conceal? Could it perhaps be God's keen awareness of our priorities and what can and cannot change them. I think we have this idea that giving information about what is good for us, wherein we will obviously take the path in our best interest no matter the personal cost to our egos.  But take a silly example like exercising and eating a healthy diet.  It is abundantly clear that practicing these things will lead to long-term wellness.  But how many of us are willing to sacrifice our comfort and desires to obey this advice?  Take a more sobering example presented in a parable by Jesus:

---

- “There was a rich man who was clothed in purple and fine linen and who feasted sumptuously every day. And at his gate was laid a poor man named Lazarus, covered with sores, who desired to be fed with what fell from the rich man's table. Moreover, even the dogs came and licked his sores. The poor man died and was carried by the angels to Abraham's side. The rich man also died and was buried, and in Hades, being in torment, he lifted up his eyes and saw Abraham far off and Lazarus at his side. And he called out, ‘Father Abraham, have mercy on me, and send Lazarus to dip the end of his finger in water and cool my tongue, for I am in anguish in this flame.’ But Abraham said, ‘Child, remember that you in your lifetime received your good things, and Lazarus in like manner bad things; but now he is comforted here, and you are in anguish. And besides all this, between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, in order that those who would pass from here to you may not be able, and none may cross from there to us.’ And he said, ‘Then I beg you, father, to send him to my father's house— for I have five brothers—so that he may warn them, lest they also come into this place of torment.’ But Abraham said, ‘They have Moses and the Prophets; let them hear them.’ And he said, ‘No, father Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent.’ He said to him, ‘**If they do not hear Moses and the Prophets, neither will they be convinced if someone should rise from the dead**.’” ~ Luke 16:19-31

Consider what this is saying. Do you believe it? Because this can easily be applied with the writing in the sky example. Could it be that the method of relating to God really begins with the attitude of our hearts, a willingness to accept whatever temporary discomfort or humbling of our self-image to access long-term, thriving livelihood.
