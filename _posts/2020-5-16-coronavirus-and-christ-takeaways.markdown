Like everyone, I'm trying to make sense of the novel coronavirus pandemic. There's so much to process through from a scientific, political, and public health perspective. I believe it is making all of us take a step back and question a lot of the assumptions we made about our life. Whether it be simple matters of mobility and convenience or heavier matters of life's fragility and brevity, this is making us reflect like we haven't in a long time. And whether you are a person participating in religious tradition or not, the question of the purpose of all of this suffering is sure to cross our minds. Speaking as someone from the Christian tradition, I believe we have confined God to an oversimplified definition of love that is just a warm fuzzy feeling of acceptance and peace. There is much to say about this, and for those interested in further discussion I'd recommend [this resource](https://adam4d.com/love/), but suffice it to say that I recognize that unhelpful tendency in myself and am seeking to grow my view of God to something more true and more able to help me. Someone who I have found helpful to give me sobering truths about God from scripture is John Piper. So when I saw he recently published a short book called [Coronavirus and Christ](https://www.desiringgod.org/books/coronavirus-and-christ), I was eager to be told straight about how I thought wrongly. Indeed, reading the book proved to helpful to me in this way. In hopes to solidify my own understanding and perhaps to be helpful to others, here is a short list of takeaways I got from the book.
1. God gives life, and he takes it away. He has this authority. He is in full control of all things.
- And [Job] said, "Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return. **The Lord gave, and the Lord has taken away**; blessed be the name of the Lord ." ~ Job 1:21
- "See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god beside me; **I kill and I make alive; I wound and I heal**; and there is none that can deliver out of my hand." ~ Deuteronomy 32:39
2. It is the same God who died in our place, to whom it is spoken about "how will he not also with him graciously give us all things" (Romans 8:32), who also could stop the coronavirus, but doesn't. 
3. It is not contradictory for God to ask us to pray for stopping something (the coronavirus) that he is simultaneously choosing for it to continue for the same reason why it is not contradictory for God to stop the his own judgment with Jesus on the cross.
- "There is no contradiction between seeing the coronavirus as God’s act and calling Christians to take risks to alleviate the suffering that it causes. Ever since God subjected the world to sin and misery at the fall, he has ordained that his people seek to rescue the perishing, even though he is the one who has appointed the judgment of perishing. God himself came into the world in Jesus Christ to rescue people from his own just judgment (Rom. 5:9). That is what the cross of Christ means."
4. God wants us to see eternal life more than our earthly comfort.
5. Once Jesus was asked "why did that bad thing happen to those people?" He responded you should repent now while you have the time (Luke 13:1–5). He completely changes the focus of the question to something he feels is far more important.
6. In the Bible, throughout church history, what seemed to be setbacks proved to be temporary situations that lead to huge steps forward not possible any other way.
7. In the news, reporters and scientists attempt to give confidence on probabilities. These are helpful, but the promise of Hosanna (meaning "God with us") is a comfort far more unshakable.

Not an exhaustive list of all worthwhile points made in the book or what would be helpful to say in this crisis, but these are what stood out to me in my reading. May we all believe these truths.

- Another Pastor who has helped me think about the coronavirus is Tim Keller. For a brief introduction, you can watch this short video:

- The issue of freewill might seem tangential in a time of the coronavirus, but the question of why doesn't God stop evil from happening is ever so relevant. This short clip of Ravi Zacharias, particularly of the parable he gives at minute five, also helps me in time like this.
