Define selfishness in your own words for a moment. Either in your mind or if it would be helpful to formulate your thoughts and / or you would like to make this more interactive, please let me know your initial best guess here:

With your notion of selfishness in mind, allow me to share the two distinct word clouds that emerged in my brainstorming:
1. thinking too much of yourself, self-absorbed, others neglecting
2. looking out for yourself more than others, thinking about what is best for you more than others

Turns out google's definition also falls into two parts: (1) "lacking consideration for others" and (2) "concerned chiefly with one's own personal profit or pleasure". 

My main argument here will be that part (1) is close but should be expanded upon and that part (2) is misleading and unhelpful. Let's begin by examining part (2), starting with a concise summary of this definition for selfishness and what would be its apparent antonym, selflessness:
- Selfishness: Thinking chiefly of self
- Selflessness: Thinking chiefly of others

There's this idea in western culture that leaders should be thinking of what is best for their constituents, not their own personal success. In christianity, the language can be even more direct -- that you should repent of your self-serving tendencies and practice self-forgetfulness. But we should be clear about the ultimate purpose of these things. What is the why behind the should? They are done because of the belief that in the long-term (perhaps even in eternity), it will benefit us to practice such things. They are ultimately self serving. Does that statement feel uncomfortable? Who comes to your mind if I were to ask you to consider the most admirable people in recent world history? A greater leader like Winston Churchill or Abraham Lincoln? A martyr for a cause like MLK Jr or Jim Elliot? Whoever it is, would you consider them "selfless"? Likely so. Do you think it would be good for you if your life resembled theirs? Surely. This may feel like a frivolous exercise, but be patient and consider the implications of this obvious fact. Do you see what we've done? It would ultimately be best for you to act selflessly, as those leaders you just thought of. It is "ultimately acting out of self interest" to be "selfless", it is "selfish" by our simple definition above to be "selfless". It is for this reason why I believe this part of selfishness's definition is misleading and unhelpful. There is an inescapable subjective, individualistic, personal way through which to evaluate all approaches to life. So to look down on someone else because they are ultimately looking out for themself but you are not is great hypocrisy and irrationality. In the place of such contradictory judgements, there should be great empathy for those who you perceive as "selfish". Do you not share the same goal as them? Do you not share the same quest for what is best for yourself? Therefore, because it is misleading and unhelpful, we should do away with this definition of selfishness: (2) "concerned chiefly with one's own personal profit or pleasure". 

Let's instead turn to part (1), "lacking consideration for others", because this sort of "others neglecting" is closer to the heart of what we mean. Let me propose the following refined definition: "selfishness is thinking that the greatest experience of life can be achieved by means of apathy and neglect to the collective". Someone might object and say that the collective would flourish more if individuals would become more independent (closer to the idea of neglecting others). I would respond and say that the person is still thinking collectively and would not be motivated by selfishness. It then becomes a discussion about what level autonomy leads to greatest collective flourishing, which is a great conversation to have. Someone on one side of the spectrum could be categorized as aloof, and on the other side needy. But these can be adjusted, and it is far better than the truly selfish. Truly selfish people would be those not interested in the collective flourishing, who instead seek personal advancement at the expense, demise, or cost to others in an ultimate sense. 

With this more refined definition, we can then approach life and others with a clearer eye for true selfishness. We can approach others who might be more shortsighted with greater sympathy and prune the "other neglecting" aspects we see in ourselves.
