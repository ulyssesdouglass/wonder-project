## Motivation
1. Move from consumer to producer
2. Start conversations with others (this is why Google doc links at the bottom are included to assist asynchronous conversations, but love to go beyond that into in-person, or over the phone conversations)
3. Snapshot of my thoughts in a formulated way (AKA journaling)

## Format
Not sure of the format of the posts yet -- not all will be artistic pros or novel ideas. Hopefully all will capture ideas that at least caused me to stop and wonder. I intend for the material to feel more philosophical and meditative than prescriptive or opinionated.

## Why "Wonder Project"?
I want to give up instant gratification for savoring curiosity and wonder that gets at the core of the human identity. My life was radically changed when I began questioning my foundations of my thinking. It felt very shaky and scary, but throughout the process I have found new and more solid ground to stand on. I love the feeling I get when I experience, “Wow, I haven’t thought of that before” or "wow, why do I think that way".
