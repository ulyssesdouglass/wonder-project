Wonder Project is just a blog with an emphasis on the concept of wonder. My worldview began to become my own when I began to wonder why I believed what I believed and acted the way I acted. Wonder, to me, means patient curiosity mixed with an open-handed enjoyment of the pursuit of truth.

I personally am starting a blog to shift my spare time more in the direction of production rather than consumption. I really do hope for this blog to trigger conversations. I've not had great experiences with comment sections, but I've had great experiences collaborating on Google docs. So if you have any responses please comment or suggest in the corresponding Google doc that is included in each page.
