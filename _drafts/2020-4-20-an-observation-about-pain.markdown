The funny thing with pain is that it makes you tempted to barter with the Divine. If only you would heal me, I'll be happy. Then when complete healing doesn't come, you ask for marginal improvements. Well at least this is me. I said if my back would just stop hurting, it doesn't need to be good enough to run, but just no pain, I'll be happy. Well, that happened and I'm now tempted to ask for more. Lord would you help me be content and give thanks in all circumstances.

- give thanks in all circumstances; for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you" ~ 1  Thessalonians 5:18
